      From residential to commercial interiors, we ensure your vision becomes a beautiful reality.
      Our team works closely with you at every stage — from design to delivery.
      With a style that’s unrestrained yet very refined, our team of New York interior designers creates homes and commercial spaces that are the visual stories of the people living or working there. KCD’s interiors are bold statements balanced by quiet details, the dark accents in a white room, the well-defined edge that contains a surprise of color.

      <h1>Interior Design that Delivers Magic in Every Moment</h1>
      <h2>
       Home is the most important space in our lives. The environment you surround yourself in defines how you live, breathe, and feel, so why not make it magical?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here at Kati Curtis Design, we create spaces that evoke magic through the use of color, pattern, and storytelling.<br>Our interior designs are not just beautiful for the sake of aesthetics, they are thoughtfully crafted for our clients to be both visually breathtaking yet perfectly livable. KCD designed homes feel like a gallery, full of culture and life and nearly untouchable, yet they are not precious in quality: they are destined to be lived in and enjoyed.<br>
        The moment I walk into a space, I can see the life that can be lived there. The joy, the excitement, the memories- it’s all clear. We use color and pattern to bring magic into a home and to create highly personal visual stories that look as though they have always existed this way. With a layered mix of styles, our designs are uniquely crafted for every client. You’ll often see something floral mixed with something edgy, something vintage mixed with something contemporary, or something raw mixed with something refined. We tailor this mix to create the perfect magic blend for every space.
